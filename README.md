# LCA-SWENG
Repo for Software engineering Lowest common ancestor problem
For this project I plan on using C as my programming language and Atom as my development environment

In a BST like the one shown below the LCA can be calculated by find the lowest node that is common to both nodes

           22
          /  \
         /	  \
       17	     4
       / \	  / \
      /   \  /   \
     3	  8 4    26

And here are some examples of the LCA of the above tree
     LCA (3,8) = 17
     LCA (8,26) = 22
     LCA (8,8) = 8
     LCA (17,4) = 22
